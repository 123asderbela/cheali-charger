 - Rapid charge start voltage: Approx. 0.8V/cell rapid charge, transition voltage restoration current: 0.2 ~ 0.3CmA
 - Upper battery voltage limit control: Approx. 1.8V/cell.
 - Intermittent timer charge ??

low priority:
 - add new "charge complete" msg
 - add calibration done sound
 - add better buzzer sound
 - add input voltage drop warning

Done:
